# Red Wine Quality Analysis

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of red wine quality using the Red Wine Quality Dataset. The project aims to determine the key features that are indicators of high-quality red wine and develop insights into the factors contributing to wine quality.

## Business Understanding

The red wine industry has experienced significant growth, with a focus on product quality certifications to promote products. However, the traditional quality assessment process is time-consuming and costly, often relying on human experts' opinions. This project seeks to bridge the gap between subjective wine tasting and objective physicochemical tests to enhance the certification and quality assessment processes.

## Project Approach

To achieve our objectives, we will take a combination of descriptive and predictive analytical approaches:

1. **Descriptive Analysis:**
   - Calculate summary statistics.
   - Create visualizations to explore data distributions.
   - Describe the characteristics of the dataset.

2. **Predictive Analysis:**
   - Build a predictive model to determine red wine quality based on available features.
   - Identify and analyze the factors contributing to wine quality.
